** Changes **
04/17/2024 I copied this app from splunkbase, as I can't seem to find a github repository. My change is swapping the configparser to accommodate splunk conf caveats


**Usage**
| inputconf conffile="inputs.conf" location="deployment-apps"

Results will be displayed as search results. No indexing!

***Locations***
* deployment-apps
* apps
* master-apps
